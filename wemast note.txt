NOTE 1

Wetlands in Southern Africa are highly productive and biologically 
diverse ecosystems that contribute significantly to livelihood and 
economic development. 

They are, however, undergoing significant pressure from both human activities 
and natural phenomena, including agriculture, land cover and land use change, 
human settlements, water harvesting, invasive species infestation, 
climate change and unsustainable development practices. 

The future of these wetlands is therefore dependent on effective assessment 
and monitoring initiatives that can inform policy and decision making to 
promote sustainable management. 
So far, inadequate human and institutional capacity and traditional data sources, 
as well as the lack of suitable and applicable spatial data, 
constrain effective wetland management efforts

NOTE 2

The WeMAST has been developed and implemented an EO-based platform that 
supports Sustainable Wetland Assessment and Monitoring Services, 
promote policy and management practices in the SADC region, 
utilize open source Satellite-based EO data and existing free software to explore:
•	hydrological and wetland Models applicable to the selected basins across Southern Africa
•	in situ data gathered from the four basins: flood regime (duration, extent, and timing), wetland inventory and landuse, vegetation dynamics (cover, density, and phenology).
•	weather and climate information from free and operational climate services
•	archived satellite-based EO data are coming from the Copernicus missions, Landsat series, MODIS Aqua/Terra products
